# Chronic-Disease-Prediction:
Developed a machine learning model to predict chronic diseases using patient health data.The project involved data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with various visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations. Implemented multiple classification modelssuch as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, optimizing their performance using hyperparameter tuning. Evaluated model effectiveness using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
# Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.
